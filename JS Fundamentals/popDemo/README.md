Popmotion is an Amazing Library that allows you to make Super Cool Animations in your Project. Have You ever wonder the Loading animation
in your Project. Yeah! Thats the same thing we can do with popmotion.

:point_down:

### How it works?



  - First we will write our HTML/CSS for the object to move and animate.
  - Second we will add the Script Boilerplate from the popmotion.io/pure/ (Maybe)
  - Inside the Script.js Folder add the CDN Link of unpkg(which is used to import the package from popmotion)
  
  
  
>_**Hmm! Quite confusing. Don't Blame Yourself. I am also Confused using the popmotion. My tip is In Web Development Never Learn the CSS
Snippets and all Styling keyword. You will be fired. Just Copy and Paste and Use as Much as you can_**

### _For Now Your Task is to Find the Boilerplate from the `PopDemo` Folder and find the files where i have written some Magic For You_
:blush:
